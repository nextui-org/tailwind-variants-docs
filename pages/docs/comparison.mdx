### Why Tailwind Variants?

A common question that we get is "Why you created **Tailwind Variants**? Why not use **CVA**?", and the
fact is that we tried to use [CVA](https://github.com/joe-bell/cva) in [NextUI](https://nextui.org) to migrate from Stitches to TailwindCSS, but we found it challenging
to create a design system solely using CVA. Then we realized that some of the features we needed were not planned
to be implemented in CVA as the creator has stated [here](https://github.com/joe-bell/cva#how-can-i-create-responsive-variants-like-stitchesjs),
so we decided to create Tailwind Variants to fill the gap. Our goal is not to compete with CVA, but to provide an alternative that meets our needs 
to migrate [NextUI](https://nextui.org) to TailwindCSS as smoothly as possible. That beign said, big shoutout to [Joe Bell](https://github.com/joe-bell) 
and [contributors](https://github.com/joe-bell/cva/graphs/contributors) you guys rock! 🤘 - we **recommend** to use CVA if don't need to generate variants 
any of the features listed above.
